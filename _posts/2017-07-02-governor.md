This November Virginians will vote to elect our Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General.  We hope to elect Democrats to continue the direction of current Governor McAuliffe and Lieutenant Governor Northam, and to re-elect Attorney General Herring.

# KEEPING THE GOVERNORSHIP
Eastern shore native, Virginia Military Institute graduate, Army veteran, and pediatric neurologist, Lieutenant Governor [Ralph Northam](http://ralphnortham.com/) is running for governor to build on Virginia's economic progress and defend our values against those who want to take us back.

# AND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNORSHIP
[Justin Fairfax](http://www.fairfaxforlg.com/) is a former assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. During his time as a federal prosecutor, Fairfax served as deputy of the Major Crimes & Narcotics Unit and as a member of the Human Trafficking Task Force. He holds degrees in public policy and law from Duke University and Columbia Law School, respectively. While studying at Columbia, he was chosen to be on the Columbia Law Review.


# REELECT OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL
Since the day he was sworn in, Attorney General [Mark Herring](https://herringforag.com/about-mark/) has worked nonstop to defend the rights of Virginia taxpayers, seniors, veterans, and military families. He has been endorsed by 43 of the state's sheriffs.
